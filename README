This directory contains files for Sketchup plugins used to design layouts for 
O-gauge train layouts. These plugins are intended to be used with applications 
trkDriver and TrkControler. In particular the plugins can provide the configuration
data tying the physical layout to the models allowing automatic control of
trains.
